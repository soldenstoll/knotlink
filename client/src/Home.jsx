            We are interested in whether playing this game can help identify a nontrivial knot
            with Jones polynomial 1, potentially offering evidence toward a new conjectural
            direction beyond the cases verified today.

          <Section title="What are knot mosaics?">
            <p>
              A knot is a simple closed curve in three-dimensional space. Because knots are often
              easier to study through two-dimensional projections, mathematicians use knot diagrams
              to record where strands cross over and under each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              Knot mosaics provide a discrete representation of these diagrams. A mosaic is built
              from a fixed collection of tiles arranged in a grid, where each tile contributes a
              local piece of the overall diagram. When the tiles are suitably connected, the grid
              represents a knot or link. This makes knot diagrams easier to encode, manipulate, and
              study computationally.

          <Section title="Who we are and why we built this application">
            <p>
              We are a student research team interested in using computation to investigate ideas in
              knot theory. This application grew out of a broader effort to study the
              knotting&ndash;unknotting game, represent knot diagrams through mosaics, and explore how
              machine learning and interactive tools can support mathematical discovery.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our motivation has evolved from building a playable and computationally meaningful
              environment toward a deeper mathematical question: whether the game can help uncover a
              nontrivial knot whose Jones polynomial is 1. For knot diagrams with fewer than 25
              crossings, a verified result tells us that having Jones polynomial 1 is equivalent to
              being the unknot. We are interested in whether experimentation through gameplay and
              computation can point toward new patterns beyond that range.

                <p>
                  The game begins with a knot shadow represented as a mosaic containing unresolved
                  crossings. Two players are assigned opposing roles: the Knotter and the
                  Unknotter.

              </div>
              <div className="border border-slate-200 rounded-2xl p-6 bg-slate-50">
                <h3 className="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Gameplay</h3>
                <p>
                  Players alternate turns. On each turn, a player resolves one crossing by choosing
                  how that crossing is completed. Play continues until every unresolved crossing has
                  been assigned.
                </p>

                <h3 className="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Outcome</h3>
                <p>
                  Once all crossings are resolved, the resulting diagram is classified. If it is a
                  nontrivial knot, the Knotter wins. If it is the unknot, the Unknotter wins.
